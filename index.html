                                        <p class="a-1"> While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.</p>

                                        <p class="second">I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.</p>
                                        <p class="a-1" >    That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.</p>
